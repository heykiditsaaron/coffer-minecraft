## Purpose

This license exists to ensure that the Coffer system, its guarantees,
and its meaning are never privatized, enclosed, or sold.

Coffer is not a product.
It is a commons.

## Non-Commercialization of the System (Absolute)

The System MUST NOT be monetized, in whole or in part.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- selling the System, in original or modified form,
- selling access to the System or System-mediated functionality,
- gating features, commands, or interactions behind payment,

  derived from the System,
- incorporating the System into commercial products or services,
- monetizing trust, evaluation outcomes, or guarantees provided by the System.

Coffer may exist on monetized servers.
Coffer itself may not be monetized.

If access to Coffer, its functionality, or its outcomes
is a reason money is requested,
this license is violated.

## Derivative Works

Derivative works, including adapters, forks, extensions, or modifications
based on or interacting with Coffer Core,
MUST be distributed under this license
and MUST NOT be sold or commercially licensed.

No derivative work may introduce monetization,

Free redistribution and modification are permitted.
Commercial enclosure is not.
