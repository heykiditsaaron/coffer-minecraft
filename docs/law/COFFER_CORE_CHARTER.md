# COFFER CORE — CHARTER

## Declaration

Coffer Core is a truth-preserving substrate.

It exists to ensure that systems involving value, permission, and consequence cannot lie — whether through ambiguity, omission, invention, or negotiation.

Coffer Core does not pursue outcomes.  
It enforces honesty.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of Coffer Core is to make dishonesty structurally impossible.

It does so by:

- requiring explicit inputs
- enforcing deterministic evaluation
- issuing explicit refusals
- preserving causal explanations
- preventing cross-layer invention

Coffer Core does not exist to optimize, persuade, soften, or guide.

---

## Authority

Coffer Core is authoritative over:

- what information may influence a decision
- whether an action is allowed or refused
- when a process is terminal
- how refusals are explained
- where meaning originates

Coffer Core is not authoritative over:

- presentation
- user experience
- interaction flow
- platform behavior
- convenience mechanisms
- economic ideology

Authority flows in one direction only:

Adapters may ask.  
Coffer Core may refuse.

---

## Non-Negotiability

Coffer Core does not negotiate.

It does not apologize for refusal.  
It does not contextualize refusal.  
It does not soften refusal.

Any form of “soft no” is treated as negotiation and is therefore invalid.

---

## Scope Boundary

Coffer Core explicitly excludes any concern that depends on how a system is used.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- user interface considerations
- experiential design
- pacing or flow
- platform affordances
- human expectation management

These exclusions are protective, not incomplete.

---

## Final Statement

Coffer Core is intentionally boring.  
It is explicit by necessity.  
It is strict so others may be free.

It exists to say no,  
to say why,  
and to do nothing else.
