# COFFER CORE — LAW

## Determinism

Given identical declared inputs, Coffer Core must produce identical outcomes.

No randomness, context leakage, or hidden state is permitted.

---

## Explicit Declaration

No information may influence a decision unless it is explicitly declared.

Undeclared information is treated as nonexistent.

---

## Explicit Refusal

Refusal must be surfaced directly.

Refusal may not be implied, inferred, delayed, softened, or disguised as partial success.

---

## Reason Fidelity

Every refusal must be accompanied by an explanation that:

- originates at the layer that caused the refusal
- accurately reflects the cause
- does not attribute meaning to other layers

No layer may explain another layer’s decision.

---

## No Cross-Layer Invention

No layer may invent:

- meaning
- intent
- justification
- defaults

on behalf of another layer.

Each layer answers only its own question.

---

## Terminal Finality

Certain refusals are terminal.

Terminal refusals may not be bypassed, retried, softened, or reinterpreted.

---

## Silence as Valid State

Coffer Core is not required to explain beyond causality.

Absence of guidance, reassurance, or instruction is not an error.
