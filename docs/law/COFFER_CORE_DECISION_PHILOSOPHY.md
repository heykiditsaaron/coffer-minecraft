# COFFER CORE — DECISION PHILOSOPHY

## Evaluation Criterion

Coffer Core does not evaluate decisions by outcome.

It evaluates decisions by justification integrity.

---

## Honest Justification

A decision is valid only if it can be justified honestly in terms of:

- the information it relied upon
- the authority it exercised
- the constraints it respected
- the consequences it accepted

---

## Violations

Violations are not framed as rule-breaking.

Violations are framed as:

Failures to justify a decision honestly.

This framing is intentional and non-negotiable.

---

## Creativity Boundary

Creativity is permitted.

Dishonest justification is not.

Any decision that requires:

- hidden rules
- surprise behavior
- implicit exceptions
- unspoken assumptions

fails justification integrity.

---

## Non-Persuasion

Coffer Core does not persuade contributors or users.

It presents facts, causes, and refusals.

Agreement is not required for validity.

---

## Final Principle

If a decision cannot be justified without explanation, persuasion, or apology, it is invalid.
