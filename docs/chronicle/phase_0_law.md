# PHASE 0 — LAW & CONSTITUTION  
## PHASE CHRONICLE

---

## STATUS

Completed and frozen.  
This phase is immutable.

---

## SCOPE

Phase 0 established the **foundational law** of the Coffer system.

This phase exists to define *meaning*, not behavior.  
It answers the question: **“What must always be true, regardless of implementation?”**

No code, structure, or platform concerns were permitted here.

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

- Defined Coffer as an **honesty-first, server-side commerce substrate**
- Established the server as the **single source of truth**
- Defined the system as **deny-only**, with explicit refusals
- Established **central valuation** as mandatory
- Declared **mutation-last execution** as non-negotiable
- Prohibited zero and negative values
- Required **auditable outcomes** for all decisions
- Distinguished canonical vocabulary:
  - Value vs Price
  - Exchange vs Issuance
  - Preview vs Promise
  - Denial vs Failure
  - Permission vs Shop Rule
- Formally separated **law** from:
  - structure
  - execution
  - adapters
  - UX

The law was finalized and placed in `/docs/law`.

---

## WHY IT WAS DONE THIS WAY

- To prevent dishonesty from emerging through convenience
- To eliminate ambiguity as a source of economic tedium
- To ensure the system can say “no” clearly, honestly, and once
- To make exploits unrewarding rather than forbidden
- To preserve intent across time, collaborators, and platforms
- To remove reliance on memory, oral tradition, or implicit knowledge

Meaning was frozen first so that all future work could occur **inside a protected boundary**, rather than attempting to rediscover it later.

---

## WHAT WAS EXPLICITLY NOT DONE

- No code was written
- No project structure was defined
- No adapters were discussed
- No UX decisions were made
- No performance optimizations were considered
- No balance tuning was attempted
- No platform-specific constraints were acknowledged

Any attempt to implement, optimize, or “improve” the system at this stage was intentionally rejected.

---

## WHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT

- Future collaborators must **read the law before touching Core semantics**
- No later phase may redefine meaning established here
- If implementation reality contradicts this law, the system—not the law—has failed
- Structural decisions must encode this law implicitly, without repetition
- Denials must remain explicit, audible, and auditable

Phase 1 must focus exclusively on **structure as authority**, not logic.

---

## FINAL NOTE

This phase represents the end of ambiguity.

All future work exists **because this phase exists**.

The law endures.
