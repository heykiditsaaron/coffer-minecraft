# PHASE 0 — LAW & CONSTITUTION  
## PHASE CHRONICLE

---

## STATUS

Completed and frozen.  
This phase is immutable.

---

## SCOPE

Phase 0 established the **foundational law** of the Coffer system.

This phase exists to define *meaning*, not behavior.  
It answers the question: **“What must always be true, regardless of implementation?”**

No code, structure, or platform concerns were permitted here.

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

- Defined Coffer as an **honesty-first, server-side commerce substrate**
- Established the server as the **single source of truth**
- Defined the system as **deny-only**, with explicit refusals
- Established **central valuation** as mandatory
- Declared **mutation-last execution** as non-negotiable
- Prohibited zero and negative values
- Required **auditable outcomes** for all decisions
- Distinguished canonical vocabulary:
  - Value vs Price
  - Exchange vs Issuance
  - Preview vs Promise
  - Denial vs Failure
  - Permission vs Shop Rule
- Formally separated **law** from:
  - structure
  - execution
  - adapters
  - UX

The law was finalized and placed in `/docs/law`.

---

## WHY IT WAS DONE THIS WAY

- To prevent dishonesty from emerging through convenience
- To eliminate ambiguity as a source of economic tedium
- To ensure the system can say “no” clearly, honestly, and once
- To make exploits unrewarding rather than forbidden
- To preserve intent across time, collaborators, and platforms
- To remove reliance on memory, oral tradition, or implicit knowledge

Meaning was frozen first so that all future work could occur **inside a protected boundary**, rather than attempting to rediscover it later.

---

## WHAT WAS EXPLICITLY NOT DONE

- No code was written
- No project structure was defined
- No adapters were discussed
- No UX decisions were made
- No performance optimizations were considered
- No balance tuning was attempted
- No platform-specific constraints were acknowledged

Any attempt to implement, optimize, or “improve” the system at this stage was intentionally rejected.

---

## WHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT

- Future collaborators must **read the law before touching Core semantics**
- No later phase may redefine meaning established here
- If implementation reality contradicts this law, the system—not the law—has failed
- Structural decisions must encode this law implicitly, without repetition
- Denials must remain explicit, audible, and auditable

Phase 1 must focus exclusively on **structure as authority**, not logic.

---

## FINAL NOTE

This phase represents the end of ambiguity.

All future work exists **because this phase exists**.

The law endures.

## Movement Alignment (Retrospective Annotation)

This phase underpins **all movements** and does not correspond to a single one.

Phase 0 exists as the immutable reference frame
against which all later work must be judged.

### Intent of the Movement

Phase 0 established that **truth is non-negotiable**.

The law defined here intentionally prioritizes:
- refusal over approximation,
- explicit denial over silent behavior,
- and determinism over convenience.

This phase exists to ensure that no later discovery,
pressure, or usability concern
can justify dishonesty.

### What Made This Movement Necessary

Before any structure, execution, or valuation could exist,
it was necessary to establish a foundation
that could not be eroded by implementation difficulty.

Without an absolute law:
- adapters would drift toward convenience,
- Core semantics would be reinterpreted,
- and users would inherit the burden of vigilance.

Phase 0 prevents that outcome by design.

### Constraints Held During the Movement

During Phase 0, the following constraints were frozen permanently:

- Truth must be explicit or denied.
- Absence is a valid and preferred state.
- No system component may invent meaning.
- No component may “help” by guessing.
- Evaluation and mutation must remain distinct.

These constraints are not subject to revision.
They are the conditions under which the system is allowed to exist.

### What Was Invented (Not Discovered)

Phase 0 invented **refusal as a moral stance**.

Not as an error,
not as a punishment,
but as the only honest response to uncertainty.

This invention reframes failure:
not as something to hide,
but as something to communicate clearly.

### What Was Explicitly NOT Solved

Phase 0 intentionally does NOT solve:

- usability,
- economy balance,
- player experience,
- platform mechanics,
- or implementation strategy.

The law does not optimize.
It constrains.

All later work exists inside these constraints.

### How This Reduced User Vigilance

By making dishonesty impossible at the system level,
Phase 0 ensures that users are never required
to second-guess outcomes or infer hidden rules.

Trust is not earned through success.
It is earned through consistency.

### Signals to Watch For in Future Work

Future changes must be rejected if they attempt to:

- reinterpret refusal as a failure state,
- weaken denial semantics,
- introduce silent defaults,
- or subordinate truth to usability.

Any such change violates the law
and collapses the system’s moral foundation.
