# Sell Menu — Conceptual Design

## PURPOSE

The Sell Menu exists to let players safely express intent:

> “I don’t want these items anymore.”

It is not a shop.
It is not a negotiation.
It is a **trust handshake**.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### Ownership First
Only items the player truly owns may be offered.
If it cannot be placed into a chest, it is not owned.

### No Surprise Mutation
Nothing is removed or credited without explicit confirmation.

### Honesty Over Helpfulness
If the system cannot proceed honestly, it refuses calmly.

### Low Anxiety by Design
Players are never blamed.
Exploration is safe.

## MIXED OUTCOMES VS PARTIAL MUTATION

The Sell Menu **permits mixed outcomes**, but **forbids partial mutation**.

- Some items may be accepted
- Some items may be rejected
- All outcomes are shown **before confirmation**

Execution is atomic:
- either everything shown happens,
- or nothing happens.

---

## EMOTIONAL GOAL

A player should feel:
- safe to experiment,
- calm when denied,
- confident when confirming,
- respected even when nothing happens.

If the player thinks:
> “Oh — that makes sense.”

The system succeeded.
