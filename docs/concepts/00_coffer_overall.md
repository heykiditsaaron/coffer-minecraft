# COFFER — OVERALL CONCEPT

## PURPOSE

Coffer is a **policy-based commerce substrate** for Minecraft servers.

Its primary goal is to **remove tedium** from both players and administrators by
**absorbing the burden of honesty into the system itself**.

Coffer does not attempt to balance economies, optimize play, or enforce behavior.
It exists to ensure that economic interactions are:
- truthful,
- explicit,
- auditable,
- and safe to refuse.

When truth cannot be established, the system refuses cleanly and calmly.

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

> Everything is permitted until it is not.  
> When it is not, the system says no — explicitly and truthfully.

Coffer does not punish.
Coffer does not guess.
Coffer does not approximate.

Refusal is not failure.
Refusal is honesty.

## HONESTY AS A SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY

In most economy systems:
- players must guess what is allowed,
- admins must micromanage edge cases,
- and trust erodes through silent assumptions.

Coffer reverses this.

The system:
- refuses dishonest exchanges,
- denies ambiguous valuation,
- explains refusals without blame,
- and performs no mutation unless truth is established.

Honesty is not a player skill.
It is a system obligation.

## BREADTH-FIRST CONFIGURATION

Coffer is designed to be configured **broadly before precisely**.

Administrators may:
- declare values at a high level,
- allow specificity to be missing,
- and refine configuration over time.

An incomplete economy is considered **valid and inert**.

Nothing is inferred.
Nothing is invented.
Nothing is forced.

---

## CENTRAL VALUATION AND POLICY

Value is treated as **explicit data**, not emergent behavior.

Valuation:
- is centralized,
- evaluated at exchange time,
- and produces auditable snapshots.

Value is never:
- guessed,
- normalized,
- or silently corrected.

---

## WHAT COFFER IS NOT

Coffer is not:
- a balancing engine,
- a permission system,
- a punishment tool,
- or a UI-driven economy.

Its strength lies in **refusal with clarity**, not enforcement.
