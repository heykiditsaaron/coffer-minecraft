# External Integration — Conceptual Guidelines

Coffer may integrate with:
- jobs systems,
- combat rewards,
- progression mods,
- or external data stores.

These integrations:
- declare inputs,
- never mutate Core directly,
- and are subject to policy evaluation.

Integration increases capability.
It must never reduce honesty.
