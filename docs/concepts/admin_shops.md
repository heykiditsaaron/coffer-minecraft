# Admin Shops — Conceptual Design

## ROLE IN THE ECONOMY

Admin shops are **intent expression surfaces**, not balance tools.

They allow administrators to:
- modify base value behavior,
- express server intent,
- and give currency a purpose.

---

## MODIFICATION, NOT CREATION

Admin shops do not invent value.

They:
- multiply,
- constrain,
- or exclude existing base value.

Example:
- Logs have base value
- Oak logs sell at 10x
- Spruce logs sell at 4x
- Unlisted logs are excluded

---

## TRUST MODEL

Admin shops are explicit.
They never silently override valuation.
They never guess intent.

They express:
> “This is how this server wants this item to behave.”

Nothing more.
