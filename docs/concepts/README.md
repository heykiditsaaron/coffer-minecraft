# Coffer — Concept Documentation

This directory contains **non-binding concept documents** that describe the
intended shape, goals, and experiential design of Coffer.

These documents exist to:
- preserve intent across time and collaboration,
- reduce repeated explanation,
- guide future design decisions,
- and align contributors without freezing behavior prematurely.

## IMPORTANT BOUNDARIES

- These documents are **not law**
- These documents are **not implementation requirements**
- These documents are **not promises**
- These documents may evolve, merge, or be replaced

If a conflict exists:
1. **Law** documents take precedence
2. **Chronicles** record what was decided
3. **Concepts** describe direction and shape

Concepts answer:
> “What are we trying to build, and what should it feel like when it’s honest?”

They do not answer:
> “What must happen in code right now?”

Read these documents as alignment tools — not contracts.
