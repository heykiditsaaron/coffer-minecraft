# Player Shops — Deferred Concept

Player shops resemble auctions more than sinks.

They were intentionally deferred because:
- they are asynchronous,
- require buffering,
- and increase system complexity.

They remain compatible with Coffer’s philosophy,
but are postponed until after MVP.

Deferral is not abandonment.
